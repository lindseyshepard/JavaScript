Hi!

Don't mind me.. Just learning some javascript!

Used for real-time app, command line tools, games etc

JavaScript Engines: SpiderMonkey and v8
(Just wait til we get to Node!)
(Another Repo...)

ECMAScript? This is a specification and JavaScript is the langauge that defines the specification

console.log('Hello World!');
